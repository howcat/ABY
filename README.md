## Topic
- Implementation and Performance Optimization of C Standard Library for Secure Computation between Two Parties.
## Folder
- [Application](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/Application) : A real-world example of an MPC program is used to illustrate how our research outcomes can lead to faster and more efficient MPC program development.
- [SIMD_Optimization](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/SIMD_Optimization) : optimizing ABY application code through vectorization techniques.
- [MPC_math](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/MPC_math) : The MPC version of math.h provides comprehensive support for the standard C library.
- [Experimental_data](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/Experimental_data) : Experimental data for performance optimization.
- [Verification](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/Verification) : Testing the implemented function content to ensure accuracy.
- [practiceABY](https://github.com/howcat/ABY/tree/main/practiceABY) : Exercises and notes on programming with the ABY Library.
